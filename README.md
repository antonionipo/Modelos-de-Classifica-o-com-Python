### üß† **Core Topics Covered**

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Situation**: Ensuring raw data is ready for training classification models.
   - **Task**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
   - **Action**: Used libraries like Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - **Result**: Clean datasets prepared for training and evaluation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Situation**: Understanding the data's structure and relationships.
   - **Task**: Visualize distributions and correlations between features and target variables.
   - **Action**: Plotted histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - **Result**: Identified key patterns and insights to guide model building.

3. **Model Development**
   - **Situation**: Selecting and training classification models.
   - **Task**: Train logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble models.
   - **Action**: Utilized Scikit-learn to train models and evaluate performance with cross-validation.
   - **Result**: Developed models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Situation**: Improving model performance through parameter optimization.
   - **Task**: Test multiple parameter combinations using grid search.
   - **Action**: Implemented `GridSearchCV` to identify the best parameters.
   - **Result**: Optimized models with improved prediction accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Situation**: Assessing the performance of trained models.
   - **Task**: Evaluate metrics and create confusion matrices for insights into predictions.
   - **Action**: Compared models using metrics like AUC-ROC and classification reports.
   - **Result**: Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
